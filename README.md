my spotify interface



pulls keywords from news headlines to build a playlist comprising of those same words



you will need:

news api key



for the spotify keys, i used this format:

```
{
'username': 'spotify username',
 'client_id': '...',
 'client_secret': '...',
 'redirect': 'https://www.google.com/'
 }
```



news key is in separate txt doc on its own



*please find versions in requirements.txt
